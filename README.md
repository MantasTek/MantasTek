ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mantas !

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My GitHub!
Hey there! I'm an aspiring software developer passionate about C# development, game programming, and database-driven applications. My journey in coding started with Windows Forms applications, where I built projects like an address book and an ad management system with SQL Server. Along the way, I explored game development in C#, creating interactive experiences like a shotgun duel game with strategic gameplay mechanics.

ðŸ’» Tech & Skills Iâ€™ve Been Learning:

C# & .NET Development â€“ Windows Forms applications, ADO.NET, SQL integration.
Game Development â€“ Object-oriented programming, structured gameplay logic, and UI design.
SQL & Databases â€“ Microsoft SQL Server, ADO.NET, and data management.
Front-End Development â€“ Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to expand my skillset.

ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Next?
I'm always improving my skills and taking on new challenges. Whether itâ€™s refining my coding projects or diving into new technologies, Iâ€™m always pushing forward. Feel free to check out my repositories and connect with me!
