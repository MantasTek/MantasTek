👋 Hi there, I’m **Mantas**

## 📖 About Me
I’m an aspiring software developer with a passion for C#/.NET, game programming, and database‑driven apps. My journey began with Windows Forms projects—like an address book and an ad‑management system backed by SQL Server—and has grown into creating interactive games (think shotgun duels with strategic mechanics). Now, I’m diving deeper into web development with ASP.NET and honing my front‑end chops in HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
