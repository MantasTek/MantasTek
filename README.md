ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mantas !

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My GitHub!
Hey there! I'm an aspiring software developer passionate about C# development, game programming, and database-driven applications. My journey in coding started with Windows Forms applications, where I built projects like an address book and an ad management system with SQL Server. Along the way, I explored game development in C#, creating interactive experiences like a shotgun duel game with strategic gameplay mechanics.

ðŸ’» What I Work On:

C# & .NET Development â€“ Windows Forms applications, ADO.NET, SQL integration.
Game Development â€“ Object-oriented programming, gameplay logic, and UI design.
Front-End Learning â€“ Exploring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to expand my skills.

ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Next?
I'm continuously improving my skills and taking on new challenges. Whether it's refining my coding projects or learning new technologies, I'm always pushing forward. Feel free to check out my repositories and connect with me!
